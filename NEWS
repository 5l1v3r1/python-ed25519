User-Visible Changes in python-ed25519

* Release 0.4 (12-Nov-2011)

In this release, the .to_string() method was renamed to .to_bytes(), since
the output is a non-printable binary bytestring.

It also adds prefix= and encoding= arguments to most data-handling methods
(key-object constructors, key-serialization, sign, and verify). These can
help with version-checking and JSON encoding.

The create_keypair() function now takes an entropy= argument, which is called
just like os.urandom, and can be used to deterministically generate keys.
This is most useful for unit tests.
